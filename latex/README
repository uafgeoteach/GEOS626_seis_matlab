classes/seismo/latex/README

This directory contains the latex source code used to make the homework assignments and labs. If you are interested in learning latex by doing your homework or labs in latex, then you can use these files as templates.

The template files require carlcommands.tex for user-defined variables. The figure files are not available (but could be if you want them).

If GEOTOOLS is installed, then the path to all bib files and carlcommands.tex should be visible. At the start of GEOS 626, carlcommands.tex should be in seismo/latex. After GEOTOOLS is installed, the seismo copy of carlcommands.tex can be deleted.

------
TO COMPILE

latex hw_matlab
xdvi hw_matlab &

TO EDIT (use some text editor like emacs or gedit)
emacs hw_matlab.tex

------
IF YOU WANT A TUTORIAL ON USING LATEX

The GEOTOOLS repository contains some instructions and examples in Latex.
(We will need to use GEOTOOLS later in GEOS 626.)
To get GEOTOOLS, execute these commands

cd
mkdir REPOSITORIES
cd REPOSITORIES
git clone /home/admin/repositories/github/GEOTOOLS

then 

cd latex_util

Open the README file ("more README" or "emacs README &") to see the instructions.

You will also find a wealth of resources on the internet.
